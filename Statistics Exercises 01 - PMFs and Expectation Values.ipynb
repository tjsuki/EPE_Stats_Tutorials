Randomly picking one such value according to a distribution is known as \"sampling\" that distribution.

Try using random.uniform(0,1) as one of your inputs to your pmf, or alternatively, try the hit-or-miss method on page 17 of these slides! https://hep1.phys.ntu.edu.tw/~kfjack/lecture/hepstat/in2/inter-2.pdf"
